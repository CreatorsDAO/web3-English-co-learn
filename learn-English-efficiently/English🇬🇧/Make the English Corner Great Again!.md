***1. What have we discussed?***
① *Why isn't the English Corner suitable for everyone?*
1.1 Each individual has unique goals. Some may aim to enhance their reading skills, yet the English Corner might not provide ample information to aid in this endeavor.
1.2 For those keen on honing their spoken English, the topics might not always align with their interests or or areas of expertise.

② *What drives you to learn English?*
It boils down to this fundamental question: No goal there, No motavition. without a clear objective, motivation dwindles.

***2. Our goals:***
**Vfan**: Master travel English, delve into Omani culture such as cuisine, costs, etc. He's slated to present on this topic this week, or else he'll transform into a gaint piggy.
**Subrina**: Engage with numerous materials & articles to glean insights from cutting-edge sectors like AI or Web3, engage in conversations, and explore ways to maintain positivity and happiness. She commits to broad reading and subsequent presentation, or she'll become a tiny piggy.
**Demian**: He's immersed in specialized areas such as cryptography and abstract algebra. This week, he'll share notes from his reading of "Atomic Habits."
**Hugh**: Intensively research the latest trends in game development and give a presentation. Or,  he risks becoming a little kitty.

***3. So, how can we make it great again??***
- continuity: Instead of a one-off session, we need regular engagement. Cultivating a habit involves cues, cravings, responses, and rewards.
- Personalization: Everyone selects their optimal learning strategy for the week, culminating in a presentation or discussion rather than sporadic conversations.

> Given the above, our consensus is to integrate English learning into our daily routines, as opposed to a singular session on a Sunday afternoon. Hence, personal planning and daily time allocation become imperative.
