- One of the best methods he proposes is the `Echo method`
- This method basically means that when you hear a word or a sentence
- don't rush to repeat it. Focus on listening and let it echo in your brain.
- Let the sound be absorbed by your brain
- then speak it out loud. It's kind of like creating a sound memory in your brain
- 我们不能只沉浸在自己“说”，应该要先去“听”，去“想”，再去说
